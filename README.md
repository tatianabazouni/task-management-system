# 📖 Project Overview

The **Task Management System** is a full-stack web application developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, and the **EJS templating engine** following the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architecture.

The application provides a secure web dashboard where authenticated users can manage projects, tasks, and users while enforcing role-based authorization. Passwords are securely encrypted using **bcrypt**, and authentication is handled through **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.

The application is designed to demonstrate the complete backend development workflow, including authentication, authorization, database modeling, server-side rendering, deployment, and CI/CD integration.
